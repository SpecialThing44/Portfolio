    description:
      "My first industry internship. I have already learned an incredible amount from engineers who have been coding for twice my lifetime. I interact very closely with all parts of the system, including core components, and even the project side. I have been able to feel real impact, as I regularly write and release production code to be used by fortune 10 energy companies.",
    accomplishments: [
      "Implemented an entire unified filtering system from scratch for a complex logistics system, participating in the design of the filters, and increasing the capability and usability of the filtering system.",
      "Wrote E2E tests in both Cypress and Playwright",
      "Developed CronJobs to handle data imports from a variety of external vendor APIs",
      "Refactored large parts of the frontend to remove significant duplicatation (Thousands of lines) and make components more modular",

    title: "Machine Learning Researcher @ Pardee Lab",
    date: "2023 - Present",
    description:
      "My first field internship on a small computational group of other software developers overseen by a PHD biologist. I have had the opportunity to learn lots about the processes of research, to submit papers, and to act as a leader of a team. I worked here full time for 4 months, and I am continuing part time for the remainder of my undergrad.",
    accomplishments: [
      "Implemented a distributed computing platform on Google Cloud using the MongoDB API to distribute the workload of protein structure prediction for a genetic algorithm, reducing the running time by a factor of ~20.",
      "Developed multiple machine learning models, mostly Pytorch based to predict protein functionality from sequence and/or structural data",
      "Implemented my own custom tree based genetic algorithm which behaves similarly to a family tree, where we always extend the tree from the best performing children",
      "Researched biology and machine learning, keeping up to date on cutting edge research in the field, and brainstorming projects of our own.",
      "Organized and distributed work to a team of 4 other developers.",
      "Managed the use of a shared workstation including multiple environments and operating systems",
      "Currently developing a paper on creating a multi-armed model to predict protein functionality with only ~120 data points, and generate new functional proteins using a genetic algorithm",
      "Also currently working on a meta analysis of protein LLMs and their performance with QLoRA adaptions.",
